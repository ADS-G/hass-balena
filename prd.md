## 6. Narrative
Sarah is a smart home enthusiast and IoT developer who manages several Balena-powered devices around her home, including environmental sensors, security cameras, and irrigation controllers. She wants to integrate these devices into her Home Assistant automation workflows because she needs a single dashboard to monitor everything and create complex automations that respond to both traditional smart home devices and her custom IoT solutions. She discovers this integration through HACS and finds that it seamlessly brings her Balena devices into Home Assistant, allowing her to create automations that trigger irrigation based on soil moisture sensors, send notifications when security devices go offline, and monitor the health of all her custom devices alongside her other smart home equipment.
